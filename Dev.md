# FPL Master Strategy: The 4-4-2 "CBIT Monster" (GW21+)

**Manager:** Devendra Dhokare (ID: 17339)
**Strategy:** **The "Diamond Hands" Accumulation ➡️ 4-4-2 Power Shift**

## 🚨 MANDATORY AI RULES

_The AI MUST follow these rules before every recommendation:_

1.  **TEAM & RATING CHECK:** Check players current team from its id and then run a check on Fantasy hub AI team rating every time before researching and suggesting players and plans for GW transfers. Link: https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/ai-team-rating
2.  **ROSTER VERIFICATION:** Always check https://fantasy.premierleague.com/statistics for active 2025/26 players.
3.  **PRICE TRACKING:** Always check https://www.livefpl.net/prices for imminent price changes.
4.  **NEWS SOURCES:** Follow David Ornstein, Fabrizio Romano, and Ben Jacobs for January 2026 transfers.
5.  **AFCON 2026 AVAILABILITY:** Until Jan 18, 2026, ALWAYS verify AFCON status (e.g., Mbeumo returns GW23).
6.  **FIXTURE TRUTH:** ALWAYS verify the official 2025/26 fixture list.
7.  **SCORING 2025/26 (CBIT):** Incorporate the new "CBIT" metric. Defenders get +2 pts per 10 defensive actions.
8.  **DATA DEEP DIVE:** Check Home vs. Away splits and H2H history before transfers.
9.  **TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE:** Monitor manager changes (Man Utd/West Ham).
10. **PLAYER PERSISTENCE:** Remember: **Ollie Watkins** is the primary striker target (£9.0m), **Alexander Isak** is INJURED until March/April 2026, **Nicolas Jackson** is at Bayern Munich (Avoid).

## 🏆 Current Squad State (GW21 Preview)

**Fantasy Hub AI Rating:** **92%** (Verified Jan 5)

- **GK:** Pickford
- **DEF:** Timber, Van Hecke, Gabriel, Alderete, Gudmundsson
- **MID:** Saka, Foden, Rogers, Cunha (MUN - Midfielder)
- **FWD:** Haaland (C), DCL, Bowen (FWD)
- **Bench:** Dúbravka, Devenny.

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Zero playable defenders for GW21. However, 92% AI Rating confirms your "Attack 7" is strong enough to carry the weight.

## 🎯 The 4-4-2 Transition Plan (GW21-25)

**Objective:** Shift structure to 4-4-2 to maximize CBIT points and the Haaland/Watkins (£9.0m) double-up.

### **Phase 1: The Accumulation (GW21-22)**

- **GW21:** **ROLL TRANSFER** (1 FT). Diamond hands.
- **GW22:** **ROLL TRANSFER** (2 FT).
- **Strategy:** Damage limitation. Rely on the "92% Rated" attack.

### **Phase 2: The GW23 "Mini-Wildcard" (3 FTs)**

- **SELL:** Phil Foden, Jarrod Bowen (FWD), Van Hecke.
- **BUY:** **Cole Palmer**, **Bryan Mbeumo**, **Lewis Hall**.
- **Result:** You lock in the Jan/Feb price rises and secure the best midfield in the game.

### **Phase 3: The 4-4-2 Strike (GW24-25)**

- **GW24:** **SELL** DCL ➡️ **Ollie Watkins (AVL)** (£9.0m).
- **GW25:** **SELL** Timber ➡️ **Antonee Robinson** (FUL) or **James Tarkowski** (EVE).
- **Formation:** Final shift to **4-4-2**.

## 📈 The "God Squad" Formation (GW25)

```text
           [Haaland] [Watkins]
[Saka] [Palmer] [Mbeumo] [Rogers]
[Hall] [Gabi] [Tarkowski] [Robinson]
           [Pickford]
```

| Position  | Player        | Strategy                                                                              |
| :-------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GK**    | Pickford      | Target: Save Bonus.                                                                   |
| **DEF**   | **CBIT Core** | Hall (Attacking), Gabriel (Set-pieces), Tarkowski (Blocks), Robinson (Interceptions). |
| **MID**   | **The Big 3** | Saka, Palmer, Mbeumo. All on penalties/set-pieces.                                    |
| **FWD**   | **Elite Duo** | Haaland + Watkins. Proven PL goal output.                                             |
| **Bench** | **Cunha**     | The ultimate 1st sub to cover rotation.                                               |

## 🛡️ Strategic Memories

- **Savinho:** Avoid due to Semenyo/rotation risk.
- **Cunha:** He is a Midfielder at Man Utd. His benching in GW21 is tactical, not a lack of quality.
- **Long Term:** This structure is designed to catch the Top 1K by GW30.
