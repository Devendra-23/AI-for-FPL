# FPL Master Strategy: Chris (The Recovery)

**Manager:** Chris (ID: 4669858)
**Strategy:** **The "Dead Wood" Purge & Starting XI Stabilization**

## 🚨 MANDATORY AI RULES

_The AI MUST follow these rules before every recommendation:_

1.  **TEAM & RATING CHECK:** Check players current team from its id and then run a check on Fantasy hub AI team rating every time before researching and suggesting players and plans for GW transfers. Link: https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/ai-team-rating
2.  **ROSTER VERIFICATION:** Always check https://fantasy.premierleague.com/statistics for active 2025/26 players and ensure minutes played > 0.
3.  **PRICE TRACKING:** Always check https://www.livefpl.net/prices for imminent price changes.
4.  **NEWS SOURCES:** Follow David Ornstein, Fabrizio Romano, and Ben Jacobs for January 2026 transfers.
5.  **AFCON 2026 AVAILABILITY:** Until Jan 18, 2026, ALWAYS verify AFCON status (e.g., Salah, Mbeumo).
6.  **FIXTURE TRUTH:** ALWAYS verify the official 2025/26 fixture list.
7.  **SCORING 2025/26 (CBIT):** Incorporate the new "CBIT" metric. Defenders get +2 pts per 10 defensive actions.
8.  **DATA DEEP DIVE:** Check Home vs. Away splits and H2H history before transfers.
9.  **TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE:** Monitor manager changes.
10. **PLAYER PERSISTENCE:** Avoid "Dead Wood" (players with 0 minutes).
11. **AUTOMATED DATA REFRESH:** Before every analysis, run `fetch_gw_stats.py --user chris` for the latest Gameweek. Update `Chris_Performance_Tracker.csv` and `Chris_Player_Performance.csv` to ensure "Weak Link" analysis is based on current xG/xA/xGC data.

## 🏆 Current Squad State (GW21 Preview)

**Weak Link Status:** **CRITICAL**. 
Chris is currently playing with only 10 active players due to **Woltemade** and a very thin defense.

- **GK:** Dúbravka (BUR)
- **DEF:** Lewis Hall (NEW), Dorgu, Heaven, Sonne, Nallo
- **MID:** Saka, Foden, Rogers, Semenyo, Rice
- **FWD:** Haaland (C), DCL, Woltemade
- **Bench:** Ortega, Nallo, Sonne, Woltemade.

### 📊 Squad Performance Matrix (GW19-GW20 Data)

| Player          | Mins | Pts | xGI (xG+xA) | Verdict        | Notes                                      |
|:----------------|:-----|:----|:------------|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| **Rice**        | 90   | 17  | 0.59        | 🔥 **NUCLEAR** | Scored 17pts on the bench. NEVER bench him.|
| **Lewis Hall**  | NEW  | -   | -           | 📈 **Target**  | Excellent GW21 entry vs Leeds.             |
| **Rogers**      | 171  | 6   | 0.57        | ✅ **Solid**    | Consistent starter for his price.          |
| **Woltemade**   | 22   | 2   | 0.04        | 💀 **Dead**    | Does not play. Primary sell target.        |
| **Sonne**       | 35   | 1   | 0.13        | 🎲 **Punt**    | Scored recently but not a nailed starter.  |
| **Haaland**     | 180  | 4   | 0.75        | 🥶 **Cold**    | Keep Captaincy; too dangerous to drop.     |

## 🛠️ GW21 Battle Plan (Tuesday Deadline)

### **The Completed Move**
*   **Transfer:** **SELL Senesi ➡️ Lewis Hall (NEW)**.
*   **Rationale:** Replaces a leaking defense with an attacking Newcastle asset for a great fixture run.

### **The "Must-Start" Lineup (3-5-2)**
*   **GK:** **Dúbravka**
*   **DEF:** **Lewis Hall**, **Dorgu**, **Heaven**
*   **MID:** **Rice**, **Saka**, **Foden**, **Rogers**, **Semenyo**
*   **FWD:** **Haaland (C)**, **DCL**

**CRITICAL ADVICE:** **START DECLAN RICE.** After his 17-point performance, benching him again is the biggest risk to Chris's rank. He provides coverage for Arsenal's attack in case Saka is quiet vs Liverpool.

## 🚀 The Rank Climb Roadmap (GW22-GW25)

**Status:** **3 Free Transfers Available (GW22)**
**Verdict:** **EXECUTE "THE DOUBLE STRIKE + ROLL"**

Chris has 3 FTs. Instead of using all three, we will address the two most critical "Dead Wood" slots and **roll 1 transfer** to GW23. This provides a safety net for injuries or price changes while still fixing the starting XI.

### **GW22: The "Double Strike" (2 FTs Used, 1 Rolled)**
*   **Goal:** Replace the two players with the lowest expected minutes/points.

**1. The Attack Fix (Priority 1)**
*   **Move:** **SELL Woltemade ➡️ Thiago (BRE).**
*   **Why:** **Thiago (£7.0m)** is the clear standout alternative to Raúl. He has superior form (5.6) and 108 total points (vs Raúl's 62). He avoids Fulham's difficult fixture run while offering better long-term value.
    *   *Backup Option:* **Evanilson (BOU, £7.0m)** if you need Bournemouth coverage.

**2. The Defense Fix (Priority 2)**
*   **Move:** **SELL Nallo ➡️ Antonee Robinson (FUL) / Milenković (NFO).**
*   **Why:** Nallo is dead weight (0 mins). Robinson is a bonus point magnet (CBIT king). This secures a reliable backline.

**3. The Roll (Strategic)**
*   **Move:** **HOLD Dúbravka.**
*   **Why:** Dúbravka played 90 mins in GW20. While not elite, he is an active starter. Rolling the 3rd FT to GW23 gives Chris 2 FTs next week to react to the January transfer window or injuries.

**Result:**
Chris exits GW22 with a fully functional Starting XI and a 2nd FT in his pocket for GW23.

**CRITICAL ADVICE:** **START DECLAN RICE.** He is in the form of his life (17pts recently). Do not bench him for Semenyo or Rogers unless fixtures are extremely skewed.


## 🔮 Long-Term Vision (The Recovery)
By GW25, Chris's squad will transform from a "broken" 10-man team to a "solid" 11-man team with coverage:

*   **GK:** Pickford
*   **DEF:** Hall, Robinson, Dorgu (Rotates)
*   **MID:** Saka, Foden, Rice, Rogers, Semenyo
*   **FWD:** Haaland, DCL, Raúl

**Result:** A team capable of green arrows every week without relying on luck.

## 🃏 GW22 Wildcard Proposal: The "Form Disruptor"

**Status:** Ready for Activation
**Bank:** **£1.8m ITB** (Chris Total Value: £100.3m)
**Formation:** 4-4-2 / 3-4-3 (Rotation Flexible)

### **The Squad**
| Position | Player | Team | Price | Form | Role |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **GK** | **Kelleher** | BRE | £4.5m | 6.8 | **Essential.** Top form keeper. |
| **GK** | **Dúbravka** | BUR | £4.0m | 3.3 | Budget cover. |
| **DEF** | **Gabriel** | ARS | £6.7m | 5.2 | Premium fixture target. |
| **DEF** | **Timber** | ARS | £6.3m | 4.3 | Arsenal double-up. |
| **DEF** | **Hall** | NEW | £5.3m | 3.7 | Attacking threat. |
| **DEF** | **Mukiele** | SUN | £4.4m | 6.0 | Massive value/form pick. |
| **DEF** | **Alderete** | SUN | £4.1m | 4.5 | High-form bench security. |
| **MID** | **Palmer** | CHE | £10.4m| 3.8 | Premium fixture target. |
| **MID** | **Rice** | ARS | £7.3m | 6.3 | **Essential.** Points king. |
| **MID** | **Rogers** | AVL | £7.6m | 6.7 | Form king. |
| **MID** | **Wilson** | FUL | £5.8m | 6.7 | Differential form gem. |
| **MID** | **Gudmundsson**| EVE | £3.8m | 2.7 | Enabler. |
| **FWD** | **Haaland** | MCI | £15.1m| 6.8 | Permacap. |
| **FWD** | **Gakpo** | LIV | £7.3m | 1.8 | High-ceiling punt. |
| **FWD** | **Kroupi Jr** | BOU | £4.6m | 3.2 | Bench enabler. |

### **Strategic Rationale**
1.  **Template Bashing:** Replaces underperforming high-ownership picks (Saka, Foden, Mbeumo, Salah) with the actual **Form Kings** of Jan 2026 (Rice, Wilson, Rogers).
2.  **Arsenal Triple-Up:** Capitalizes on Arsenal's easiest fixture run of the season (Gabriel, Timber, Rice).
3.  **Financial Warchest:** Leaves **£1.8m in the bank**. This allows Chris to jump on any January transfer window bandwagon or upgrade Gakpo/Kroupi effortlessly.
4.  **Rotation Immunity:** Every bench player (Wilson, Mukiele, Alderete) has high form and 90-minute security.

## 🛡️ Strategic Memories
- **Rice Rule:** Always start the inform player, regardless of the fixture (Home/Away).
- **Bench Fodder:** Chris has too much "Dead Wood". Priority is getting 11 starters.
