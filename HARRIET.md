# FPL Master Strategy - Harriet (The Title Defense)

## 🚨 MANDATORY AI RULES
1.  **TEAM & RATING CHECK:** Check players current team from its id and then run a check on Fantasy hub AI team rating every time before researching and suggesting players and plans for GW transfers. Link: https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/ai-team-rating
2.  **ROSTER VERIFICATION:** Always check https://fantasy.premierleague.com/statistics for active 2025/26 players.
3.  **PRICE TRACKING:** Always check https://www.livefpl.net/prices for imminent price changes.
4.  **RANK TRACKING:** Always check current overall rank and live rank at https://www.livefpl.net/rank.
5.  **TRANSFER INSIDER CHECK:** During Jan 2026, ALWAYS check Fabrizio Romano, Ben Jacobs, and David Ornstein for confirmed transfers.
6.  **AFCON 2026 AVAILABILITY:** Until Jan 18, 2026, ALWAYS verify if a player is participating in AFCON (e.g., Salah, Mbeumo).
7.  **FIXTURE TRUTH:** ALWAYS verify the official 2025/26 fixture list. Check for "Blanks" and "Doubles".
8.  **SCORING 2025/26 (CBIT):** Incorporate the new "CBIT" metric in player evaluation. Defenders get +2 pts per 10 defensive actions.
9.  **DATA DEEP DIVE:** Before recommending a transfer, ALWAYS check Home vs. Away form splits and Head-to-Head (H2H) history.
10. **TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE:** Monitor manager changes (Man Utd/West Ham).

## 🏆 The "Veteran Hunter" Strategy (GW21-25)
**Philosophy:** "Mirror & Block". 
When leading against a Veteran manager (ID 1618354), you do not win by being "different". You win by preventing them from being different to you.

### 🕵️ Rival Profile: 1618354
*   **Rank History:** 13k, 37k, 45k. This is an elite manager.
*   **Tactics:** Chases value and fixtures early. He will almost certainly have Haaland/Palmer/Saka.
*   **Weakness:** He is 5 points behind. He *has* to take risks eventually. Harriet must neutralize those risks.

## 🛠️ GW21 Battle Plan (Tuesday Deadline)
**Fantasy Hub AI Rating:** (Check https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/ai-team-rating)

### **The "No-Hit" Priority Move**
*   **Transfer:** **SELL Van Hecke ➡️ Lewis Hall (NEW)**.
*   **Rationale:** The Veteran will likely identify Hall as the best Newcastle defensive entry for their Leeds (A) fixture. By buying Hall, Harriet mirrors his likely move and protects her 5-point lead.

### **The Captaincy Anchor**
*   **Captain:** **Erling Haaland**.
*   **Why:** Do NOT differential captain Palmer. If the Veteran captains Haaland and he hauls, the league lead is gone. Stick to the robot.

## 📊 The "Title Defense" Roadmap

**GW21 (Jan 7):**
*   **Move:** Van Hecke ➡️ Lewis Hall.
*   **Captain:** Haaland.
*   **Note:** Bench Wilson vs Liverpool. Do not take a hit to remove him.

**GW22 (Jan 17):**
*   **The "Price Shield" Move:** **SELL Timber ➡️ Gabriel (ARS)**.
*   **Rationale:** Gabriel's price is rising (£6.6m). Mirroring the Veteran's likely Arsenal double-up (Gabriel/Saka) is essential before the Forest game.

**GW23 (Jan 24):**
*   **AFCON Watch:** Check if the Veteran is buying **Mbeumo** or **Salah** back. Match his move if funds permit.

## 🛡️ Strategic Checklist
1.  **Block the Veteran:** Always check if Rival 1618354 has made a "surge" move.
2.  **Save the Wildcard:** Use it only when the Veteran does, or during a Double GW.
3.  **Stay Templated:** You are 1st. The burden of risk is on the rivals, not you.
