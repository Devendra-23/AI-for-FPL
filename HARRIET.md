# FPL Master Strategy - Harriet (The Title Defense)

## 🚨 MANDATORY AI RULES
1.  **TEAM & RATING CHECK:** Check players current team from its id and then run a check on Fantasy hub AI team rating every time before researching and suggesting players and plans for GW transfers. Link: https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/ai-team-rating
2.  **ROSTER VERIFICATION:** Always check https://fantasy.premierleague.com/statistics for active 2025/26 players.
3.  **PRICE TRACKING:** Always check https://www.livefpl.net/prices for imminent price changes.
4.  **RANK TRACKING:** Always check current overall rank and live rank at https://www.livefpl.net/rank.
5.  **TRANSFER INSIDER CHECK:** During Jan 2026, ALWAYS check Fabrizio Romano, Ben Jacobs, and David Ornstein for confirmed transfers.
6.  **AFCON 2026 AVAILABILITY:** Until Jan 18, 2026, ALWAYS verify if a player is participating in AFCON (e.g., Salah, Mbeumo).
7.  **FIXTURE TRUTH:** ALWAYS verify the official 2025/26 fixture list. Check for "Blanks" and "Doubles".
8.  **SCORING 2025/26 (CBIT):** Incorporate the new "CBIT" metric in player evaluation. Defenders get +2 pts per 10 defensive actions.
9.  **DATA DEEP DIVE:** Before recommending a transfer, ALWAYS check Home vs. Away form splits and Head-to-Head (H2H) history.
10. **TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE:** Monitor manager changes (Man Utd/West Ham).
11. **AUTOMATED DATA REFRESH:** Before every analysis, run `fetch_gw_stats.py --user harriet` for the latest Gameweek. Update `Harriet_Performance_Tracker.csv` and `Harriet_Player_Performance.csv` to ensure "Weak Link" analysis is based on current xG/xA/xGC data.

## 🏆 The "Veteran Hunter" Strategy (GW21-25)
**Philosophy:** "Mirror & Block". 
When leading against a Veteran manager (ID 1618354), you do not win by being "different". You win by preventing them from being different to you.

### 🕵️ Rival Profile: 1618354
*   **Rank History:** 13k, 37k, 45k. This is an elite manager.
*   **Tactics:** Chases value and fixtures early. He will almost certainly have Haaland/Palmer/Saka.
*   **Weakness:** He is 5 points behind. He *has* to take risks eventually. Harriet must neutralize those risks.

| **Thiaw**       | 180  | 21  | 0.68        | 🦸 **Hero**    | 17pts in GW20. Unbenchable form.           |
| **Garner**      | 180  | 20  | 0.98        | 💎 **Gem**     | 16pts in GW19. Massive differential.       |
| **Palmer**      | 152  | 9   | 1.04        | 🛡️ **Steady**  | High xGI. The points will come.            |
| **Haaland**     | 180  | 4   | 0.79        | 🥶 **Cold**    | Robot malfunction? Keep Captaincy on him.  |
| **Wilson**      | 168  | 8   | 0.60        | ✅ **Useful**   | Solid enabler.                             |
| **Van Hecke**   | 180  | 6   | 0.13        | 📉 **Sell**    | Low ceiling. Correct decision to sell.     |

## 🛠️ GW21 Battle Plan (Tuesday Deadline)
**Fantasy Hub AI Rating:** (Check https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/ai-team-rating)

### **The Completed Priority Move**
*   **Transfer:** **SELL J.Timber ➡️ Gabriel (ARS)**.
*   **Rationale:** Secures the most nailed and goal-threatening Arsenal defender. Gabriel's price is rising, and this move mirrors the elite "Veteran" manager who likely already has Arsenal defensive coverage.

### **The Starting XI Strategy (3-5-2)**
*   **GK:** **Petrović** (vs TOT).
*   **DEF:** **Gabriel** (vs LIV), **Thiaw** (vs NFO), **Van Hecke** (vs MCI).
*   **MID:** **Saka**, **Palmer**, **Foden**, **Thiago**, **Garner**.
*   **FWD:** **Haaland (C)**, **DCL**.
*   **Bench:** Dúbravka, **Wilson** (1st Sub), Heaven, O'Reilly.

**Key Decision:** **Bench Wilson (vs CHE).**
With Everton playing Wolves (Home) and Brentford playing Sunderland (Home), **DCL**, **Garner**, and **Thiago** (fresh off a hat-trick) all have superior fixtures to Wilson.

### **The Captaincy Anchor**
*   **Captain:** **Erling Haaland**.
*   **Why:** Standard "Safety First" play for the leader.

## 📊 The "Title Defense" Roadmap

**GW21 (Jan 7):**
*   **Move:** J.Timber ➡️ Gabriel (Completed).
*   **Captain:** Haaland.
*   **Note:** Watch Lewis Hall's performance; he is the next defensive target.

**GW22 (Jan 17):**
*   **Confirmed Plan:** **SELL O'Reilly (£5.3m) ➡️ Mukiele (£4.3m)**.
*   **Why:** This is the priority move. Mukiele is the highest-form defender available under £5.0m. This move solidifies the bench, fixes the "O'Reilly weak link," and banks £1.0m in cash for the GW23 push.
*   **Note:** Keep an eye on Wilson's minutes; he is the next likely candidate for a swap if his form drops.


**GW23 (Jan 24):**
*   **AFCON Watch:** Check if the Veteran is buying **Mbeumo** or **Salah** back. Match his move if funds permit.

## 🛡️ Strategic Checklist
1.  **Block the Veteran:** Always check if Rival 1618354 has made a "surge" move.
2.  **Save the Wildcard:** Use it only when the Veteran does, or during a Double GW.
3.  **Stay Templated:** You are 1st. The burden of risk is on the rivals, not you.
